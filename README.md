## Hi there 👋
I’m **Rohan**, a Computer Science undergraduate who builds what he imagines.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll try to prototype it, automate it, or turn it into a project. I like experimenting, learning fast, and shipping things — even if they’re messy at first.

### 🛠 My tech stack

Java, C, Python, Data Structures, Git, GitHub, Selenium, and Figma.

I move between coding and design a lot — sometimes writing scripts, sometimes sketching interfaces, sometimes just breaking things to understand them better.

### 📁 What lives in this repo space

You’ll mostly find:

* Python automation projects
* small tools and utilities
* practice problems
* UI/UX experiments
* learning projects (some polished, some chaotic 😄)

### 🎯 What I’m working toward

* Becoming a stronger software developer
* Building cleaner, more useful projects
* Landing a solid internship or entry-level role

### ✨ Fun facts

* I’m into fitness  💪
* I like anime 🎬
* I enjoy tinkering with tech and random ideas

If you like what you see, feel free to explore, fork, or drop a ⭐
Happy coding!
